My passion for technology extends beyond my professional life, driving my continuous learning and experimentation with new systems and software. I also have a homestead with 15+ chickens and enjoy spending time with my family managing the homestead.</p>

            <h2>Homelab Setup</h2>
            <p>My homelab setup is a cornerstone of my personal and professional development. The setup includes two Dell OptiPlexs running as Proxmox nodes in a cluster. It includes multiple VMs including: a Plex server running on Debian, a Wazuh SIEM also on Debian, a torrent VM on Ubuntu, and a TrueNAS NAS system. There are also various other VMs in this enviornment. This setup allows me to experiment with different technologies, improve my skills, and manage various IT services effectively from home.</p>
